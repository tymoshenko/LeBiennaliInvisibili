    The Mayor does not necessarily believe everything The Ambassador tells her when she describes the
    Biennials visited on her expeditions, but the Mayor does continue listening to the celebrated cultural
    advisor, and former curator, with greater attention and curiosity than she shows any other cultural
    attaché or UNESCO representative of hers. In the careers of leaders there is a moment which follows
    pride in the eclectic line up of the cultural pursuit we have exhibited, and the excitement and
    fulfillment of knowing we shall soon celebrate any thought of collecting and publicizing them.
    “Biennials can make or destroy your city, Ma’am” the Ambassador would warn “It is up to you, to
    choose wisely the alchemy of terms and accents of the gathering you want to create”.<br>
    <br>
    There is a sense of contemplation that comes over us in the morning, with the sound of commuters
    after eight o’clock and the fumes of traf ic filling streets and squares; a fogginess that makes the
    buildings and neighborhoods blur on the semi-orthogonal grid of the horizon. From this horizon, a
    series of curators show up, one after the other, reporting to us the reviews of the last visiting critics,
    from libel to laudatory, and printouts of the articles of renowned artists who af irm our curatorial
    production, of ering in exchange periodic submissions of Biennial themes, budget proposals, contact
    sheets. A sea of tote bags, of memories of chance encounters, of air-kisses, of new names and new
    zeitgeists.<br>
    <br>
    On this occasion, The Mayor has summoned the Ambassador to report on Biennials from far away
    lands to prepare her own Mayor’s Biennial. It was through the websites and catalogs destined to be
    archived, The Mayor started realizing that the construction of realities could be diverse enough to
    escape the spectator’s conventions. “But, Mrs. Mayor, if one thing you should know about Biennials,
    it is this: the collaboration between minds and the gathering of spirits has spread as far as beyond
    our scope and control. What might have begun as a singular cultural event, has spread into
    myriads of autonomous formations, each of which can seduce and enthrall everyone; even those who
    never visited, even Biennials that never existed.”<br>

        Not all biennials are the same. Neither will they return to being what they once were. However, the format of showcasing new work, triggering discussions, and letting new canons emerge, as a time-based event that takes place once every two years at the same location, has become the pilgrimage for the culture industries in the new millennium. Biennials - or biennales, a bastardization of the italian original term that has slipped into as many different languages as locations - not only have the power to forge discourse, but also transient communities united by gatherings every two or three years, and cities that are momentarily transformed and forever associated with those festivals of human culture.<br>
        <br>
        Le Biennali Invisibili is a project that explores eleven imaginaries of such encounters, under the same lens that Italo Calvino created when describing alternative urban realities in his book Le città invisibili (Invisible Cities). Le Biennali Invisibili embraces fiction and pseudo-reality as a framework for curatorial pursuit, as a series of virtual events, proposing and critiquing the conventional celebration of the design & art community.<br>
        <br>
        Le Biennali Invisibili is a project by animali domestici (Alicia Lazzaroni and Antonio Bernacchi), Tijn van de Wijdeven, and Eduardo Cassina. It is curated by Alfons Hug and commissioned by the Goethe-Zentrum Baku.<br>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Bottavia</p>
<br>         
In Bottavia, which includes contributions both from north and south, with installations, photography, models, artifacts, and so on, there is a script through which you can sense how the Biennial takes form. At first sight, nothing seems to resemble Bottavia’s Biennial less than the machinery that runs the script itself, racks of CPUs and wires whose patterns are repeated along straight and circular lines, interwoven with brilliantly coloured spires, in a repetition that can be followed throughout the whole system. But if you pause and examine its open code carefully, you become convinced that each operation performed by the script has its own objective in the almost infinite process of pre-selection of the artists, from literary anywhere, and all the things contained in the Biennial are related to some hidden affinity, arranged according to their somehow “true” relationship, which escapes your eye distracted by the bustle, the throngs, the shoving. <br>
<br>
All of Bottavia’s confusion, the memes’ proliferation, the TikTok videos, the countless webpages is what is evident in the incomplete perspective you grasp; but the script proves that there is a point from which the Biennial shows its true proportions, the “neural” scheme implicit in its every, tiniest detail. It is easy to get lost in Bottavia’s contents: but when you concentrate and stare at the program’s giant leaflet, you recognize the installation you were seeking in a crimson or indigo or magenta thread which, in a wide loop, brings you to the purple enclosure that is your real destination. Every contributor of Bottavia compares the scripts' immobile order with his perspective of the art scene, an anguish of his own, and each can find, concealed among the arabesques, an answer, the story of his life, the twists of fate. <br>
<br>
An AI geek was questioned about the mysterious bond between two objects so dissimilar as the structure of the script and its curatorial concept. One of the two objects -he replied- has the form the big data gave to the internet itself in which the worlds embody their virtual counterparts; the other is an approximate reflection, like any automatic creation. For some time the augurs had been sure that the script's harmonious machine learning routines were of a new generation that the world had yet to understand. The geek was interpreted in this sense, arousing no controversy. But you could, similarly, come to the opposite conclusion: that a truly unbiased map of the universe is the Biennial of Bottavia, just as it is, a stain that spreads out shapelessly, with crooked links, contents that crumble one upon the other amid clouds of data, streams, screams in the darkness.<br>

Conversation between Merve Bedir and Bager Akbay<br>
<br>
Merve Bedir is an architect based in Hong Kong. She works at the intersection of the technologies of labour, landscape, mobility, and commons. <a href="https://www.aformalacademy.com/">https://www.aformalacademy.com/</a> & <a href="http://landandcc.com/"> http://landandcc.com/ </a><br>
Bager Akbay is an artist-as-researcher based in Istanbul. <br>
<br>
Merve Bedir: I research the <a href="https://automated-landscapes.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/https%3A/automated-landscapes.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/research/automated-landscapes-pearl-river-delta">automation of labor</a> in the factories of Pearl River Delta region, as well as an unrealized 2018 Hong Kong Biennale exhibition proposal called "Collective Intelligence," where we wanted to research the coalescing forms of intelligence among peoples and nonhumans. For this conversation with you as a joint contribution to the Invisible Biennale exhibition, my interests were your former works "Deniz Yılmaz" (bot poet) and "Shepherd" (bot curator). Shepherd, especially, as a metaphor for the curator fascinates me. Shepherd is the one who cares and is responsible for the herd.<br>
<br>
Bager Akbay: The shepherd looks after the herd, but also the one who leads it. Prophets were almost always shepherds before becoming, some politicians describe their former work as being shepherds, in Ancient Greece philosophers were not allowed to engage in any profession but could only do shepherding. Curating is as such a hierarchical position. The curator might be creating your identity while caring for you, or it might be creating space for you to flourish.<br>
<br>
Merve: In the factory, there are three roles, the blue collar, the white collar, and the boss. In our research we found that human labour is still preferred to robots, while bots used for operation replace the human middle manager (white collar labour) in the workplace.<br>
<br>
Bager: In fact, it is labour that changes form. The blue collar becomes the robot, the white collar becomes the operation bot. I'm curious about the form and nature of the boss, the leader (in our case, the curator). A cooperative works on three kinds of charters, initiating, operation, and decommissioning. If you include the other two charters, the operation charter could change towards leadership. Here, the leader is the contract, the operation, the code. If the codes are open, if the human language of the protocols are clear/ can be identified, and if this language can be decided by the people, that's a good exhibition, or a real society.<br>
<br>
Merve: It's the value systems that define the codes, isn't it? On the one hand the value systems define the characteristics of the curator, and on the other, the curator (singular or collective) defines the value of an art work, how important/significant that work is, and also how much it’s worth.<br>
<br>
Bager: Curator is like a cell's membrane, it takes the input from its participants and reflects the output back to them, or to outside. Similarly, leaders reflect the characteristics of their societies. In "Shepherd" my idea was to leave all decision making to the bot curator, as the cell's membrane. I started forms for different jobs regarding an exhibition in a Human Resources website, people applied to it for the different positions in the exhibition, such as defining a concept sentence for the exhibition, a workflow, commissions, translations, and so on. There was an open call, artists applied, and the process was completely organized according to the open code of the bot.<br>
<br>
My point is that humans are adaptation machines. If you put a human in a society it will take the form of the society. The form of society is political, which is shaped by laws and the cultural codes. If we change the rules of the law, the society inside will change. A company works with its own operational codes. It can act with different values in different parts of the code/algorithm, for instance it could be more communist in human resources, while being liberal in distributing profit. We need to see that these codes are political. If we can analyze what is good or bad in these codes, what works better in which way, the differences of the governance models, etc. then we can also see what mode requires what quality, what problem requires what control mechanisms, and so on. These codes and modes need to be open and developed based on consensus.<br>
<br>
Merve: In the laws of the cooperatives (or companies), we still don't/won't have the initiation and decommissioning as bots, though. "Shepherd" is an inspiration in that sense, that this is a possibility in governance.<br>
<br>
Bager: Governance is a self-conscious mechanism/system, a matter of cybernetics. We can understand the laws of a system only by being self-conscious, the robots can work without being self-conscious, which is a problem, but the bots can, to a certain extent, which is interesting. In "Shepherd," the applicants, who declared they can curate the exhibition, cross-voted among themselves about who should really do it. At every step there was such a self-control process for qualification and consensus. The exhibition as a process and outcome was so natural and so smooth that no one realized anything. This is striking because this is also how things happen in the real world.<br>
<br>
Merve: Well, Constant suggested that in future all blue-collar work will be done by robots and humans will become architects. But, I feel you think the opposite, as humans should/will actually continue blue-collar work, while codes/algorithms become leaders.<br>
<br>
Bager: Which mode do you think is closer to human nature? Think of a mayor, how can they govern one million people, right? It just doesn't make sense. I'm thinking we should be doing more blue-collar work, and then transparent, open-code algorithms (rules, laws) could lead.<br>
<br>
Merve: But historically, the leader has always been outside the law.<br>
<br>
Bager: Yes, that's people not leaving the decision to the existing law, but creating exceptions. That's why governments love crises, because this gives them the possibility of suspending the law, and continuing their sovereignty. Think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">The DAO</a> in France, with the recent crisis they had, if they let it to the algorithm, The DAO should have shut down, but they changed the algorithm and continued. When the leader is the algorithm, there are no exceptions and no bad leaders. If the code is open, the leader will be open and transformed, too. We criticize our leaders but we do the exact same things in our lives.<br>
<br>
Merve: Same goes for curating.<br>
<br>
Bager: Exactly. Essentially, people should discuss and decide on the code, and the code should be organizing how to continuously discuss. The curator is this code. Then, art is doing what you see, and what you want to see. This attitude is not included in the scope of other disciplines anymore. That's why I'm interested in art. This is why I am working on <a href="https://mahlas.network/">Mahlas now</a>.<br>
<br>
Merve: I want to go back to the question of consciousness for a last note. Before, we talked about the self-consciousness of an algorithm and society. This really makes me think of the 2019 Hong Kong movement. What happened in Hong Kong was this self-consciousness of a movement, and utilizing open code software as tools to help the movement of this self-consciousness. We know this worked because the same consciousness also has led to a success of managing the pandemic in the city. To witness the possibility of a leaderless governance in this example is mind blowing.<br>
<br>
Bager: It is about how we define the leader, and the algorithm/ the bot. The leader and the algorithm are nothing but contracts. They are rules and regulations. Who we are, is who our workers, managers, curators, or leaders are. As I said before, what we need to make sure is to keep the source code open and transparent, discuss how it's run. Also we need to diversify the tools, and the decision making mechanisms based on issues. The algorithm you use for one issue may not be suitable for another. There cannot be one formula, one answer to every question.<br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Canonice</p>
<br>
Never in all my travels had I ventured as far as the Triennale of Canonice. It was dusk when I landed there. At the entrance of the main venue, the assistant curator who welcomed me with the catalog in his hands, “the Architecture we have always Built”, resembled a professor who had taught me 30 years before and was dead. I was invited to tour the exhibition and, at the same time, to examine some old publications to understand how the show used to be: the same plans and sections in black and white instead of more saturated colours, a hand-carved timber model instead of gently CNC milled, another model to contemplate the coherence and poetry of a space instead of trendy collages. To not disappoint the curators, you must praise the old publications together with the current one, and you must be careful to contain your regret at the absence of any significant change: highlighting in your dialogues the eternal relevance of architectural fundamentals, the indisputable role of architecture drawings, the unquestionable methodologies of architectural design and the unmissable role of architectural references, you need to express a contained but visible excitement for the epidermal deviations from the canon, praising their foresight and the progeny of the canon in all the corners of the kingdom. If Canonice had remained unchanged because this is its own true skin or the mask it is convenient to wear, I don’t know, and nobody in the kingdom dares to guess.<br> 
<br>
A young architect was meticulously drawing the imperfection of a concrete wall as if it was an onyx slab from Madagascar, and I thought I recognized him; when I turned, he had disappeared down the corridor, but I realized that he looked like the assistant curator who, already old when I was a child, could no longer be among the living. I turned my gaze aside and I no longer dared look anyone in the face. I thought: "If Canonice is a triennial I am seeing in a dream, where you encounter only the dead, the dream frightens me. If Canonice is a real Triennale, showcasing the work of living people, I need only to continue looking at them and the resemblances will dissolve, alien faces will appear, bearing anguish. In either case, it is best for me not to insist on staring at them." <br>
<br>
An elegant architect was scrupulously cleaning a diorama with miniature velvet curtains, to arrange it on a table together with other models of the same kind. He raised his face: he was Aldo Rossi. I thought: "You reach a moment in life when, among the people that inspire your work, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept new paradigms and new expressions: on every new work you start, it tries to print the old forms, to each one it finds the most suitable mask." Perhaps, to him, I also resemble someone who was dead. I had barely arrived at Canonice and I was already one of them, I had gone over to their side, absorbed in that kaleidoscope of line-weight, solid timber, plaster casts. I thought: "Perhaps Canonice is the Triennale where you arrive dying and where each finds again the masters he has known. This means I, too, am dead." And I also thought: "This means the beyond is not necessarily new."<br>

The Wall<br>
<br>
Neophobia is the fear of anything new. In its milder form, it can manifest as the unwillingness to break from routine.<br>
<br>
“Accepted and approved by those who were before us, and devoted to us in the inadmissibility of any deviation, innovation, or abolition in their content ...<br>

<br>
2nd Canon of the V-VI Ecumenical Council<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Today, many agree that the biennales have become obsolete, even though currently there is no other format comparable in its prominence. Recently, every corner of the world has wanted to place itself on the map of modern art tourism by way of participation in the Biennale. It was vitally important for every artist to be included in the group of participants, despite the awareness of the hypocrisy of the corporate-managerial elite, which runs the contemporary artistic system, and its political correctness, which limits individual freedom of creative expression.<br>
<br>
In the era of universal automation, sovereign Internet, trade wars, and other signs of the times, the price for international megaprojects has become too high for organizers increasingly doubting the need to pay for their own critique.
The biennales used to be a compromise and are even more so now, during the recession of the biennale boom, although it is still they who define the progressive social and aesthetic agenda in contemporary world culture.<br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
A modern man, freed from the shackles before the individualistic society, which both limited and provided him with security and peace, did not acquire freedom in terms of realization of his personality. In most cases, a person is not yet mature enough to be completely independent and objective. The cultural and social crisis of our days is reflected directly in the meaning of freedom for a modern person, as well as on the problem of interconnection and interaction between psychological and sociological factors of social development.<br>
<br>
The new history was conditioned by efforts aimed at acquiring freedom from the political, economic, and spiritual shackles that bound a person aimed at victory over the forces of totalitarianism. Despite numerous defeats, freedom usually prevailed. History has confirmed that a person can control himself, make decisions by himself, think, and feel as he deems right.<br>
<br>
It is paradoxical that although freedom brings a person independence and rationality of his own existence, it simultaneously isolates him, awakening in him a feeling of powerlessness and anxiety. This isolation is unbearable, and a person is faced with a choice: to either get rid of freedom with the help of a new dependence, new submission, or grow to the full realization of positive freedom based on the uniqueness and individuality of each.<br>
<br>
If we consider the problem of a person and his freedom and lack of freedom and imagine that space is freedom, while the constraint of space is non-freedom, then the image of a wall that ascends in its functional basis to an absolute forbiddance is precisely what represents a system of prohibitions in the social structure. The horizon, however, can be viewed as an image of experience - contours, and outlines that are not inherent in objects in reality but traced in them by our perception, brought into the world by our finite presence. Any experience, in its most important feature, reveals the property of finitude, which means that experience always has boundaries. Since these boundaries are not laid down once and for all but are shifting, changeable, they form horizons.<br>
<br>
Thus, the experience that humanity has is always on this side of the horizons, while they continue to shift. The world is something that precedes all experience, a miracle, and a mystery that instills concern in the existence of man and makes him seek salvation in the existing order of things.<br>

Neophobia is the fear of anything new. In its milder form, it can manifest as the unwillingness to break from routine
Неофобия — боязнь чего-либо нового. В более мягкой форме это может проявляться в нежелании отказываться от рутины

Сегодня многие согласны с тем, что биеннале изжили себя, хотя при этом никакого иного сопоставимого по значимости формата на данный момент не существует. Недавно каждый уголок мира хотел обозначить себя на карте современного арт-туризма посредством биеннале. Для каждого художника жизненно важным было оказаться в обойме участников, несмотря на осознание лицемерия корпоративно-менеджерской̆ элиты, заправляющей̆ современной̆ художественной̆ системой̆ и ее политическую корректность, ограничивающую индивидуальную свободу творческого самовыражения.<br>
В эпоху всеобщей автономизации, суверенных интернетов, торговых войн и прочих примет времени, цена за интернациональные мега проекты стала слишком высокой для организаторов, все чаще сомневающихся в необходимости оплаты собственной критики.
Биеннале и раньше были компромиссом, а теперь во времена спада биеннального бума тем более, хотя по- прежнему именно они заявляют прогрессивную социальную и эстетическую повестку в современной мировой культуре.  <br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Современный человек, освобожденный от оков до индивидуалистического общества, которое одновременно и ограничивало его, и обеспечивало ему безопасность и покой, не приобрел свободы в смысле реализации его личности. Человек в большинстве случаев еще недостаточно созрел, чтобы быть совершенно независимым и объективным. Культурный и социальный кризис наших дней отражается непосредственно на значении свободы для современного человека, а также на проблеме взаимосвязи и взаимодействия между психологическими и социологическими факторами общественного развития.<br>
Новую историю обусловили усилия, направленные на завоевание свободы от политических, экономических и духовных оков, которые связывали человека, направленного к победе над силами тоталитаризма. Несмотря на многочисленные поражения, свобода в целом побеждала. История подтвердила, что человек способен управлять собой, сам принимать решения, думать и чувствовать так, как ему кажется верным. <br>
Парадоксально то, что хотя свобода приносит человеку независимость и рациональность его существования, она в то же время изолирует его, пробуждая в нем чувство бессилия и тревоги. Эта изоляция непереносима, и человек оказывается перед выбором: либо избавиться от свободы с помощью новой зависимости, нового подчинения, либо дорасти до полной реализации позитивной свободы, основанной на неповторимости и индивидуальности каждого. <br>
Если рассматривать проблему человека и его свободы и несвободы и представить, что пространство – это свобода, а запрет на пространство – это несвобода, то образ стены, восходящей в своей функциональной основе к абсолютному запрету, и представляет собой систему запретов в общественном устройстве. Горизонт же можно рассматривать как образ опыта - контуры и очертания, не присущие предметам реально, но прочерчиваемые в них нашим восприятием, вносимым в мир нашим конечным присутствием. Любой опыт, в качестве важнейшей своей черты обнаруживает свойство конечности, что означает, что опыт всегда имеет границы. Поскольку эти границы не положены раз и навсегда, но подвижны, изменчивы, они образуют горизонты. Имеющийся у человечества опыт, оказывается тем самым, всегда по эту сторону горизонтов, при этом они непрерывно сдвигаются. Мир же — это то, что предшествует всякому опыту, чудо и загадка, вселяющие беспокойство в существование человека и заставляющие его искать спасения в существующем порядке вещей.<br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Palimpsestia</p>
        When you enter the exhibition of Palimpsestia, you might rejoice in observing, and absorbing, the gargantuan amount of information that is available to you: models from previous editions are layered on top of each other, projectors of different ages casting images and shadows over a compound alloy of information panels, and scaled prototypes of different eras. This Biennial, unique among architectural events, remains a favorite among the cognoscenti: now on its twenty-third edition, Palimpsestia's only policy, and its most distinguishing feature, is that all of which is exhibited (models, projectors, television screens, and media players, and countless other devices that have been used by architects and curators to express ideas of space and light) remains wedged in their position, permanently. Curators and presenters of Palimpsestia have to address not only their curatorial pursuits but also the context in which they are presented.<br>
        <br>
        The cumulative amalgamation of exhibition displays over the years is no stranger to the citizens of Palitomograd, the city that hosts Palimpsestia every two years, who, rather familiar with the amassing ambitions of the Biennial, have seen several of their municipal buildings overflow with exhibition paraphernalia. Worried that Palimpsestia would eventually submerge all of their old palaces, its disused arsenal, libraries, and museums, undercoats of architectural ideas and metaphors, the citizens of Palitomograd voiced their apprehension to the organizers. “What is a delightful archive of the evolution of architectural discourse, a wunderkammer of sorts, to some, is a hoarding threat to others”, I heard many of them repeat to any candid visitor who would listen.<br>
        <br>
        The ever-growing abundance of accouterments, as well as the by-now nefarious dispute between the curators of the fifteenth and sixteenth editions (the former originally decided to erect a wall of polystyrene foam over the architectural effigies, prototypes, walls, ceilings, and floors, as if the remains of the previous editions had been covered by a shroud; whereas the latter decided to dissolve them with chemical glue to reveal once again the past regalia), triggered an organizational and cognitive shift, one of the most abrupt known in the history of Biennials: by the 18th edition, a distinct curatorial sentiment had been distilled, in contrast to previous paradigms of grandeur and flamboyant statements. From that juncture onwards, every Palimpsestia curator has been as attentive to the tenability of prospective editions, for all intents and purposes, as much as to their present one.<br>
        <br>
        To this day, any visitor, whether an expert in Palladio or categorically unfamiliar with the world of architecture, is capable of observing the abundance of space-conscious works, as well as astute exhibition design solutions that support the circulation of visitors among new oeuvres, and their antecedents. Yet, as the years sum up, the sunsets and sunrises accumulate, and the dust settles, as any visitor would tell you, one is left to wonder how many more Palimpsestia editions are left, how many more exhibitions will there be space for?<br>

      Failed Biennials<br>
      <br>
      By recycling the materials we use for the installations or exhibitions is also in some way recycling the past ideas and problems bringing them to light again. In this sense the scarcity of innovation and progressive thinking becomes obvious. Reusing the same concepts, materials and topics does not let us go beyond the margins and this practice somehow blocks the innovative and urgent critical thinking in us.<br> 
      One exhibition follows the other and over and over again the same routine takes place. The organizing of a “Biennial” like event becomes a usual business for cultural sector, the city, the curator and everybody else involved in it.<br> 
      One day will come when we will say it is enough when the overload of materials, permanently renewing events, new exhibitions, non-stop new information available for the audience transforms into an intellectual chaos. This tremendous amount of material cannot be perceived anymore as something important one can keep in his brain. We organize exhibitions about the environmental crisis, about our broken planet and at the same time produce so much garbage that we do exactly the same thing we are criticizing.<br> 
      Enough is enough and the day will arrive when so much information will be converted into a big useless chaos and this practice of organizing Biennials will eventually fail. The question is how long can we live with all these different events offering one installation after another and one exhibition following the other? Does all these afford really bring us something important? Can the Biennials really act as catalysts for change? Who are the remaining caretakers when the “Biennial” is over? What sense does it really make to organize an overload of exhibitions every two years?<br>
      These questions keep bothering us and the various intellectuals in the architectural and art world start criticizing these kind of events and in many cases call them a waste of time, materials and money.<br>
      As the years pass and one edition of the Biennial follows the other in different parts of the world this idea of creating an event in such manner slowly becomes absurd. One might say that the concept of the  “ Biennials” as we know it are already fading away. The progressive revival of the concept is urgently needed and anything else in our society “Biennials” should also reflect to the current environmental and urban state we live in.<br>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Puerrilia</p>
        Puerilia welcomes two types of audiences: children or adults. The Biennial displays one face to adults and a different one to children, who curate the event and produce the content. When a mature visitor sees, in the roughness of the warehouse, the pinnacles of the cakes and sweets come into view, the diary-looking pamphlets, the early adolescence reminiscent collages, the girly bedroom corners, he thinks of an unusual birthday party; he knows it is a Biennial, but he thinks of it as a vessel to enjoy frivolous youthful celebrations, a playground about to cast off, lifted by pastel-toned balloons, or a cute gathering for handicrafts, innocent and naive; and he thinks of the peach times of his childhood, the memories of the toy cranes unloaded on the docks, but also the city outside the Biennial, where crews of different background break bottles over one another's heads, the Reality. In the warehouse hall, children discern the form of the unapologetic party of Puerilia, an embroidered mixture of glittering fringes and activist toolkits, unashamedly overlapped; they know it is a Biennial, but they think of it as a multitude of matters to be used, broken, hacked, decorated, and already they see themselves as the head of an afternoon climate strike, or eating cakes and exchanging friendly suggestions in the cozy corners, among DIY necklaces with the names of their new loves and earth charter manuals to discuss new forms of citizenships. They lay on the floor where young girls are dancing barefoot, moving their arms, with hand made crowns made of daisies in their hair.<br>
<br>
The resulting aesthetic of Puerilia, the assemblage of its decoration, handy works, settings, costumes, food, is unexpectedly refreshing: something off is always present, embraced and multiplied, in a swarm of unstructured contributions. Those works are not manufactured with extreme precision, the settings in which they stand have unclear colour schemes, the cakes, and the other desserts, offered to every visitor, have way too much cream on top, and taste very sweet to a mature palate. The catalog of the current edition, called “Evolving Pains” is intriguingly assembled: contributions flow between mundane and serious matters, politics, dear diary, more than human care, poetry, fun, fiction, everything else.<br>
<br>
There are three hypotheses about Lise Anison, Puerilia’s child curator: that she hates the adults; that to keep independence she avoids all contacts, even with her own family; that she is an adult invention and she never existed, and the adults are all behind Puerilia’s success, never tired of praising it, collage by collage, diary by diary, cake by cake, contemplating with fascination their absence. Each Biennial receives its form from the model it opposes; and so we see Puerilia, a Biennial for Children and by Children.<br>

      The gift, or when the pleasure of eating a piece of birthday cake frightens the child<br>
<br>
Araks Sahakyan is a multidisciplinary artist, researcher and translator based in Paris.<br>
<a href="https://www.papercarpets.com/en">https://www.papercarpets.com/en</a><br>
<br>
“When we are unhappy, we are afraid of pleasure.
Not only do we not have the desire for pleasure,
but we are ashamed of the idea of ​​having pleasure.”
Boris Cyrulnik<br>
<br>
“and that child they buried this morning cried so much
it was necessary to call out the dogs to keep him quiet.”
 Federico García Lorca<br>
<br>
One day per year, the birth of a being is celebrated, and turning six is ​​an important event in one’s life. It is a turning point where the child starts school, enters into the ranks and statistics of "passes" and "fails". Progressively, this being stops wondering about the invention of butterflies, communicating with a ladybug, sending messages with paper airplanes, or creating earrings with a couple of cherries. Thus, the autocracy of adult wishes is imposed.<br>
<br>
Between conflicts and desires, an interaction is established between children and adults. But what is this relationship like? Neuropsychiatrists warn that children who do not receive sufficient attention during their early years can develop almost irreparable sequelae in the brain. In the absence of affection and lullabies, these once grown children experience shame for having pleasure.<br>
<br>
One day per year the birth of a being is celebrated and turning six is ​​to feel firsthand what being thrown into the world means. If before there was a little interaction, now there is an excuse: "You are older, you can do it alone." Thrown into the world… the child cries because there is no one to pick him up at the end of the day, because he feels ashamed to wonder about the invention of bridges or because he stands in front of a candy display case without a coin.<br>
<br>
Between loneliness and superficial commitments, the child of six years old once at home continues expressing anger and sadness. In the presence of the adult, he represses his emotions and starts to smile and laugh to satisfy him. Perhaps a survival strategy to get the hot plate of the day.<br>
<br>
One day per year the birth of a being is celebrated and turning six is ​​an important event in one’s life. From that moment on, we hold the child responsible and deprive him of the pleasures of childhood. We also deprive him of that linguistic ability with which he was born. To the surprise of adults, children from all continents find a common language to communicate: the language of onomatopoeia and interjections, the language of universal emotions such as joy, sadness, surprise, or fear. But also, the love they share for a three-layer sponge cake with delicious chocolate cream and strawberries.<br>
<br>
And whoever does not have that cake will imagine it and then create it, even using the soil. The child will even eat a piece of it, because his conviction that he deserves a birthday cake is stronger than the puerile idea of ​​thinking that one can live without celebrating his birthday.<br>
<br>
Turning six is ​​an important event in one’s life. From the age of six, the child starts school, enters into the ranks and statistics of "passes" and "fails", into the dictatorship of adult desires. The child begins to repress his own pleasures. The child begins to obey this other repressed child, which is the adult. However, what is the right of the adult to take away the imagination of a child? As if that adult knew about the invention of butterflies, as if he knew about the way to talk to a ladybug, about sending messages with paper airplanes, about creating earrings with a couple of cherries... As if that adult knew that it is not necessary for the mechanics to move a car, as if that adult knew that religions or ideologies are not indispensable to answer to universes mysteries and know what is wrong or what is right, because the child has its own way to understand the world and just by the gesture of removing the petals of a flower will get an answer to all the questions.<br>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Referenda</p>
<br>         
The man who is traveling and does not yet know the Biennial awaiting him along his route wonders what the installation will be like, the selected artworks, the curatorial concept, the catalogs, the merchandise. In every kermesse of the empire, the structure to design such events is clear and everybody has its own role, the curator, the assistants, the staff, the artists, the visitors. As soon as the stranger arrives at the unknown event, his eye can penetrate the hierarchy of who is managing and who is displaying, and he immediately distinguishes which works are more beloved and praised, which men are more influential, which topics are more relevant.<br>
<br>
This is not true of Referenda. Every person involved in this Biennial can, in turn, decide on every single matter, may it be the works to be exhibited, the cleaning protocols, the graphic design, the lecture series, the food selection at the cafeteria, the price of the ticket. Without a pyramid and a representative model, everyone is in charge of everything. I reached Referenda a morning of spring, eight months before the opening, during the voting process. I was unable to distinguish the typical features I was used to: circular tables were scattered in a large room where several consultations were happening side by side, supported by different media. The ‘Referenda Digital Platform’ was hosting the final selection of artists, a remote meeting was held to decide on the installation layout, a physical discussion just ended on the colour scheme of the visual identity, several polls were due the same day, to decide on catering, publications, and open source policies of the entire event, a matter that everybody considers essential.<br>
<br>
I turned myself into a Referendario, so are called the people involved in the event, he was raising his hand, making an “L” shape between his thumb and index finger. “What are you doing?” I asked. “I’m talking with the Referenda Pidgin” he explained, “a shortcut body language to effectively communicate shades in opinions, in the process of decision making”. His other hand was holding a smartphone, managing several polls at the same time, the decisions he kept distinct in his media, in his mind mingled. I wondered: if decisions of all those aspects are done by all, Referenda is the Biennial of indivisible existence. But why, then, this Biennial is what it is? What line separates the who from the what, the rumble of wheels from the howl of wolves?<br>

      <h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Rexia</p>
<br>
No artistic gathering has a more obscure inception story than that of the Biennial of Rexia, the most ancient of cultural events known to humans. It is no surprise that its origins remain a mystery to many. Everyone concurs that its first edition was nine hundred thirty-two years ago, for there is enough evidence for that claim, but what attendees often seem to forget is that it commenced as a religious pilgrimage event, where artisans from the region of Nackchi, where Rexia took place, would flock to flaunt, flash and emblazon their latest creations and crafts smothered in devotional fervor about God, or the Prophet’s life. Over the centuries, as winds -and their names- changed, earthquakes shivered the Earth, and civilizations rose and fell, Rexia had naturally evolved into an agnostic artistic event, desacralized and emancipated from any religious trace.<br>
<br>
If a facet that has remained untouched throughout time was to be mentioned, scholars would agree that such an immutable element would be the election ceremony of its main, and sole, curator; a figure directly appointed by the curator of the previous edition. This promulgation, known as Denuntiatio Ad Regime, the auspices of which have been known to travelers and locals, cognoscenti and illiterates, occurs, since time immemorial, the day after the aperture of the Biennial. In front of all attendees, among all the fervency and zeal, the current curator solemnly proclaims the name of the curator for the next edition. The secrecy around the promulgation, as well as the anticipation, have historically triggered tremendously emotional scenes in the audience, often followed by a profound murmuration of gossip and commentary, muffed by clapping, cheer, and, at times, gasps.<br>
<br>
The position of Chief Curator of Rexia, the pinnacle of absolute curatorial virtues, is coveted by curators from all cardinals points, eager to enter the cannons of History of Art. In its four hundred sixty-six editions, the position has only been rejected on one occurrence. The unabridged power characterizing the role of Chief Curator of Rexia, a position like no other, where appointees do not have to answer to anyone but their ambitions, where budgets know no limits, and infrastructure is of the highest quality known, often turns events into largely dramatic, yet often disjointed, monuments to their custodian’s egos. For this reason, no critic has ever considered Rexia an influential event. <br>
<br>
Yet, if I must speak to you about its importance, it is not its repercussion, but on its archive, that one must consider. Rexia has a library whose contents have been intensely studied by scholars, collectors, and artists, containing all physical, and, more recently, digital, documentation of every single precedent edition. Ancient parchments and scrolls coexist with unsold catalogs, samples of posters, lost tote bags, and exhibition brochures with curatorial statements, all of which are archived in the most rigorous chronological order. This tremendous archive has matured into a pilgrimage destination known to all in the art world, the visit of which remains a rite of passage that everyone who calls themself artist, curator, or historian, must, at least once in their lifetime, complete. The same fate, however, is not shared by the Biennial exhibition per se, which has been perceived, for at least the past three centuries, if not earlier, as an ephemeral addendum whose only paramountcy is the Denuntiatio Ad Regime ceremony on the second day of the event. There are no official visitor statistics of the exhibition, for they would disclose this mournful truth. You might face difficulty looking for people who cherish the actual event when it is happening, as most do so retrospectively when it can be studied and dissected from the printed elements left behind, within the walls of the library; when it can be observed in connection to a larger sequence of editions that came afore and after it. <br>
<br>
Art philomaths are delighted to confabulate theories around the curatorial shifts, the desacralization of the event, the discursive tensions that have emerged between different editions, or, a personal favorite, the conspiracy around the appointments. Some particular editions have been absorbed into the art historians’ canons ecumenical, such as those when curators had misread the intentions of their heirs resulting in Biennials of antagonistic persuasions, or when for certain periods nepotism and partisanship affected the appointments for Main Curators for several editions in a row, turning Rexia into a stale event. These episodes, as any reputable art historian would confirm, have been normally followed by a series of decidedly surprising, and chaotic editions. The cumulative succession of turns -often good, at times detrimental-, the lamentable decisions, the expected and unexpected results, and the manifestation of curatorial egos stretched over the elephantine existence of the event, were the main attractions of Rexia. Regardless of the unexpected shifts, its continuation remains certain: if I were to speak of what ascertains the survival of Rexia, is the resolute compliance and reverence to the Main Curator’s orders, no matter who they are, or how delirious their wishes present to be.<br>

REXIA, TOO<br>
<br>
Georg Seeßlen. studied painting, art history, and semiotics in Munich. He is a lecturer and curator of film programs and art exhibitions. He has written books on Film, Art & Politics. He features on the German radio alongside Markus Metz.<br>
<br>
No artistic gathering has a more obscure inception story than that of the Biennial on Planet Rexia, near the End of the Universe, just some lightyears away from that famous restaurant where healthy people used to look at the great apocalypse night after night. It was the last cultural event mankind would be able to perform. It is no surprise that most of the people, looking forward to the ultimate explosion didn’t give a damn to the mysterious event called “Rexia Art Gathering Surprise“ - RAGS in short. But on the other hand, there were groups of enthusiastic art lovers, true believers in the eternal power of art. Pure art, and nothing but art. Art that won’t save our lives, but will last forever and ever. Every one of them concurred that this last edition would take place nine hundred thirty-two days from the day the art councils of planet Earth had assembled to take their last decision: Every piece of art of the doomed planet should be brought to Rexia, a planet without dust, without humility, without wind… and without life. There was enough evidence for that aim, mainly because for a lot of people there was nothing else to do. (Who would struggle for careers, when the end is apparently near?) Not all the attendees stuck to it, but in the end, it was a religious pilgrimage event, where artisans from all continents would flock to flaunt, flash and emblazon their best creations and that of their ancestors and heroes in the long history of art on earth, smothered in devotional fervor about Nature and the men and women who had seen it through artist’s eyes. Over the centuries as winds - and their names - changed, crises and catastrophes had shivered the Earth, and civilizations rose and fell. Only the works of art had survived and been passed from one dying civilization to the other emerging. The name of Rexia, where the first Biennial took place some centuries ago, was given to the small planet, where the last Biennial should be staged, surviving all men, surviving every civilization, surviving every Goddess. Rexia had naturally evolved into a spiritual event, sacralized and emancipated from any trace of market, hype, and fuzz. <br>
<br>
The remaining problem for this biggest and last artistic effort was to elect its main, and sole, curator because there was no time left for discussions and democracy. The election ceremony was easy and quick: The hundred most influential persons in the International art scene choose the SUPER-KURATOR. And because life tended to be short in the last days of mankind, every SUPER-KURATOR appointed his or her successor for the next step in this sacred project: finding the 100 000 works of art worth for bringing them to Rexia. This promulgation, known as Denuntiatio ad Fatum Artis, had been known to TV-audiences and Newschatters all over the world because it seemed the most interesting thing about the whole Rexia-Mission. A lot of people who would not distinguish Rafael from Van Gogh, did know the name of the SUPER-KURATOR. After a while, the SUPER-KURATOR was as popular as presidents, kings, and revolutionaries, and the Denuntiatio was televised frequently. (No SUPER-KURATOR seemed to survive in his position more than a week, which may underline how challenging the work of curators was till the end of curating itself.) In front of all attendees of the mission, among all the fervency and zeal, the current (and exhausted) SUPER-KURATOR solemnly proclaimed the name of the next curator. The secrecy around the promulgation, as well as the anticipation, triggered tremendously emotional scenes within the audiences, often followed by a profound murmuration of gossip and commentary, muffed by e.mails, sky-phones, and mental storm waves. People would jump out of their windows, kill their neighbors, or riot in the streets when their favorite curator was not nominated. "Who will be the SUPER-KURATOR“ was the most popular TV-Show internationally broadcasted. Curators and nominees had to be carefully protected, because of the danger of getting killed or kidnapped by fans. <br>
<br>
The position of SUPER-KURATOR of the Rexia-mission, the pinnacle of absolute curatorial virtues, was coveted by curators from all cardinals points, eager to enter the cannons of History of Art. Every SUPER-KURATOR left his traces in defining the essence of art and deciding, which work of art would be saved for cosmic eternity on Rexia. In its four hundred sixty-six days’ history, the position had only been rejected on one occurrence. The unabridged power characterizing the role of the SUPER-KURATOR (every one of them hoped for longevity, but mysteriously no one had enough time than to choose roundabout 50 works of art for the Rexia-mission), a position like no other, where appointees did not have to answer to anyone but their own ambitions, where budgets knew no limits, and disjointed, monuments to their custodian’s egos. For a brief slot in time, the SUPER-KURATOR was kind of God or Goddess. For this reason, no one was listening to critics. How dared they argue the last Biennial in the Art History of Men! <br>
<br>
Yet, if I must speak to you about its importance, it is not on its cultural repercussion, but on its civil impact, that one must consider. Rexia generated a proud narrative. Because of the art, that was to be saved from the big explosion, humans would leave a heritage and would not vanish without leaving something important. Many people tried eagerly to be part of the Rexia-mission, knowing very well, that landing on Rexia, finding the right place for the works of art, and following the last curatorial orders would be the last thing in their lives. No one would survive on Rexia, but after all, no one would survive on earth. Of course, there were only a small crew needed, so in order to become at least a spiritual member of the mission, people began to study the history and the theory of art, they acclaimed (or did not so) the work of the SUPER-KURATORS and they hated the critics, especially those, who denied the deep cultural and (more or less) religious sense of the Rexia-mission. The archives of art were intensely studied by scholars, collectors, and artists, containing all physical and digital documentation of every single precedent step by the SUPER-KURATORS and their explanations, both in the historical and the Ästhetik context. Art was the new - and last religion. Art was the new - and last ideology. Art was the new - and last reason to live. People gathered in the archives. Ancient parchments and scrolls there coexisted with unsold catalogs, samples of posters, lost tote bags, and exhibition brochures with curatorial statements, all of which are archived around the world in very different orders. But the tremendous archives had matured into a pilgrimage destination known to all, not only in the art world, and the visits to every kind of art archive, museum, library, collection emerged into a new rite of passage, the great farewell in the name of Rexia. Once before the big explosion, nearly everyone (including those who wouldn’t give a damn at the beginning of the Rexia-mission) must perform such a rite: Being part of the SUPER-MISSION: Man will die, but art will survive.<br> 
<br>
The same fate, however, is not shared by the mission of the Last Biennial itself, which had perceived, more and more, for the last hundred days, if not longer, as an ephemeral addendum whose only paramountcy is the Denuntio ad Fatum Arts-ceremony and the inauguration of the SUPER-KURATOR every now and then. There are no official statistics about the real knowledge of the works of art chosen for the Rexia-mission, for they would disclose this mournful truth. The new religious art had no real content. You might face difficulty looking for people who cherish the actual event of the mission and how it is happening, as most do so prospectively, when it could be studied and dissected from the broadcasted elements left behind, within the circuits of followers and friends of Rexia. The art-religion of the Rexia-mission were both, fundamentalistic and superficial.<br>
<br>
The small group of art philomaths however were delighted to confabulate theories around the curatorial shifts, the strange sacralization of the mission, the discursive tensions that had emerged between different regimes of the SUPER-KURATORS, or, a personal favorite, the conspiracy around the appointments. Some particular “chapters“ have been absorbed into the narration of the end as ecumenical (fate or guilt?) such as those when SUPER-KURATORS had misread the intentions of their heirs resulting in decisions of antagonistic persuasions, or when for certain periods nepotism and partisanship affected the appointments for SUPER-KURATORS for a certain time, turning the Rexia-mission into a stale event (including declining “likes“ and followers). These episodes, as even any reputable art critic would confirm, had been normally followed by a series of decidedly surprising and chaotic curatorial politics. "This you call a masterpiece?“ We heard some people gasp (and "whataboutism“ got a new meaning). The cumulative succession of turns - often good, at times detrimental -, the lamentable decisions, the expected and unexpected results, and the manifestation of curatorial egos stretched over the elephantine existence of the mission, were the main attractions of Rexia. Regardless of the unexpected shifts, its continuation remained certain: If I were to speak of what ascertains the survival of the Rexia-mission till the end, ist the resolute compliance and reverence to the SUPER-KURATORS orders, no matter who they were, or how delirious their wishes presented to be. <br>
<br>
When the Rexia-mission started, taking 100 000 works of art to post-human eternal life, it left us not only with some kind of transcendental hope but also with a new concept of leadership. Three days after the WARHOLA 1 started its flight, an Icelandic scientist discovered a bug in the algorithm that predicted the end of the world. The big explosion is canceled. Mankind will live on. If only without the 100 000 masterpieces of art, which will live on Rexia, without dust, without humidity, without wind, and without life. Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever… <br>
